## P02-Overloading Operators
### Delton Hughes
### Description:

- This program was to create our own Vector Class which would allow us 
to manipulate the data in several different ways. 



### Files

|   #   | File      | Description                      |
| :---: | --------- | -------------------------------- |
|   1   | main.cpp  | Main driver of my list program . |
|   2   | Banner.cpp| Banner uploaded.                 |                  
|   3   | input.dat | Text File                        |
|   4   | input1.dat| Text File
### Instructions

- Use the commented instructions on how to use method commands.
- Need the #include <fstream> library
- Needs input.dat and input1.dat
- Layout is like below

### Example Command

  -  v1.pushFront(18);                //pushes number to the front
 *      -  v1.pushRear(18);           //pushes number to the back
 *      -  v1.print();                //prints to outfile
 *      -  Vector v2(A,5);            //creates an array
 *      -  x = v1.popFront();         //takes off the front and deletes
 *      -  v2.inOrderPush(27);        //makes list of ints increasing order
 *      -  x = v1.popRear();          //pops rear value
 *      -  x = v2.popAt(3);           //pops specific value
 *      -  x = v2.find(51);           //finds specific value
 *      -  Vector v4("input.dat");    //reads list from an input file
